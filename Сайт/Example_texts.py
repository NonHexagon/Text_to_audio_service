I read a fun fact about the brain\t
And how it starts to deteriorate when\t
We get to 27 or there abouts.\t
It got me thinking about my head\t
And what I can do to help stimulate it\t
Makes me sad but...\t
I forgot what I'm on about.\t
\t
Looked on the brightside, got keratitis.\t
And you can't sit there until you're righteous.\t
I wear a happy face like I'm Ed Gein.\t
I feel all numb now, is that a feeling?\t
Like all plastic boxed orange with no peel on.\t
I wanna waste, I wanna waste, I wanna waste away.\t
\t
Alone getting high on a Saturday night\t
I'm on the edge of a knife\t
Nobody cares if I'm dead or alive\t
Oh what a wonderful life\t

I'm a whisper lost upon wind\t
I'm the ember that will burn you down\t
I'm the water that will drown you\t
I'm a star that's just a black hole now\t
I'm a terrifying danger\t
I'm fruit decaying on the ground\t
I'm a swallower of anger\t
I'm the tree that falls and makes no sound\t
I make no sound...\t
\t
â€˜Cause if I stand up, I'll break my bones\t
And everybody loves to see a fall unfold\t
Ain't nobody giving up, 'cause nobody gives a fuck\t
Stand up and break my bones\t
Everybody wants what they just can't hold\t
There's nobody praying for me\t

One thing, I don't know why\t
It doesn't even matter how hard you try\t
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme\t
To explain in due time all I know\t
Time is a valuable thing\t
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings\t
Watch it count down to the end of the day\t
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal\t
Didn't look out below\t
Watch the time go right out the window\t
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know\t
I wasted it all just to watch you go\t
\t
I kept everything inside\t
And even though I tried, it all fell apart\t
What it meant to me will eventually be\t
A memory of a time when...\t
\t
I tried so hard and got so far\t
But in the end it doesn't even matter\t
I had to fall to lose it all\t
But in the end it doesn't even matter\t

Space may be the final frontier\t
But it's made in a Hollywood basement\t

Cobain can you hear the spheres\t
Singing songs off station to station\t

And Alderon's not far away\t
It's Californication\t

Born and raised by those who praise\t
Control of population\t

everybody's been there\t
And I don't mean on vacation\t
First born unicorn\t
